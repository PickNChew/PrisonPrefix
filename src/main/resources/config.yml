# Prefixes can be configured like so
#
# identifier:
#   prefix1:
#     permission: "prefix.1"
#     priority: 10
#     prefix: "&r[&cPrefix 1&r] "
#   prefix2:
#     permission: "prefix.2"
#     priority: 100
#     prefix: "&r[&bPrefix 2&r] "
#
# The permission is the permission required for the prefix to display. If the player has no permissions for any of the prefixes within a identifier,
# a prefix will not be shown.
#
# The priority of the prefix determines which prefix will be shown if the player has more than one permission within the same identifier.
# For example if a player both the permissions, prefix.1 and prefix.2, prefix 2 will be shown because it has a priority higher than prefix 1.
#
# Prefixes can be inserted in the chat by placing the {identifier} in the chat format. Identifier being the group of the prefixes as shown above.
